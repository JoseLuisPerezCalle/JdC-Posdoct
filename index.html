            <p>This research focuses on integrating advanced machine learning techniques with spectroscopic methods to tackle challenges in food safety and fire investigation. By utilizing tools such as FTIR, Vis-NIR, and E-nose systems, it enhances the detection of adulteration in products like honey and juices, where traditional methods often fall short. Additionally, it improves the analysis of ignitable liquid residues (ILRs) in fire debris by automating and optimizing data interpretation. This approach not only increases reliability and efficiency but also promotes more sustainable and accessible practices.</p>
              <p>
                The main purpose is to demonstrate the potential of combining machine learning with analytical techniques to transform complex data into actionable insights, benefiting industries, research, and quality control processes.

                These studies integrate advanced spectroscopic techniques such as FTIR, Vis-NIR, and IMS with machine learning algorithms to rapidly and accurately detect and quantify adulterations in juices. The graphs, including spectra, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), offer a clear and accessible presentation of the key findings.</p>        
                <!-- PCA -->
                <h5>Principal Components Analysis (PCA)</h5>
                <p>PCA was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the spectroscopic data, allowing for easier visualization of the variability between the juice samples. As shown in Figure 2, PCA successfully separates grape juice from the other juices, particularly in FTIR (Figure 2A) and IMS (Figure 2B), where the grape juice occupies a distinct position along the first principal component (PC1). This highlights significant spectral differences between grape juice and the other juices, such as apple, pineapple, and orange.</p>
                <p>In contrast, Vis-NIR (Figure 2C) displays a different trend, with grape juice clustering closer to apple juice in the principal component space, suggesting greater similarity in their spectral profiles. This may indicate that Vis-NIR has a lower capacity to distinguish between grape juice and the other juices compared to FTIR and IMS. Since grape juice was used as the adulterant, this observation may have implications for the detection of adulteration.</p>
                <p>Overall, all three techniques demonstrated varying degrees of success in differentiating the juices based on their principal components. FTIR and IMS showed clearer separations, while Vis-NIR displayed some overlap between certain juice types.</p>            <div style="text-align: center;"> <!-- Estilo para centrar el botón -->

                <!-- HCA --> 
                <h5>Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)</h5>
                <p>The HCA results, presented in Figure 3, show dendrograms for each of the three techniques, revealing patterns consistent with the PCA findings. Both FTIR (Figure 3A) and IMS (Figure 3B) successfully group the juice samples into distinct clusters. FTIR, in particular, perfectly separates the four main juice types into individual clusters, with further subclusters identifying samples by brand. IMS also shows a similar trend, though the grape juice is further divided into two distinct clusters based on the brand, indicating potential differences in their spectral profiles.</p>
                <p>Vis-NIR (Figure 3C), however, shows a more diffuse classification pattern. While some grouping according to juice type is observed, the separation is not as clear as in FTIR and IMS. Similar to the PCA results, apple juice appears closer to the grape juice adulterant, and some subclusters are mixed. Pineapple juice is mostly grouped together, although one sample, "P_CA_1_R1", is separated from the main cluster.</p>
